# Database Migration Notes

## Schema Alignment with Go Models

This document tracks the database schema alignment with the Go models in the Thothix application.

### Completed Migrations

#### 2025-06-13: Added system_role to users table

**Problem**: The `users` table was missing the `system_role` field required by the User model.

**Solution**: Added the `system_role` column to the users table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN system_role text DEFAULT 'user';
```

**Verification**:

- The field was successfully added with the correct type and default value
- All existing users will have the default role of 'user'
- The backend starts without errors and can handle the new field

### Current Schema Status

All tables are now aligned with the Go models:

✅ **users** - Complete with system_role field  
✅ **projects** - Aligned  
✅ **project_members** - Aligned  
✅ **channels** - Aligned (type field removed as expected)  
✅ **channel_members** - Aligned  
✅ **messages** - Aligned  
✅ **files** - Aligned (has some extra fields but no conflicts)  

### Notes

- The `channels` table no longer has a `type` field, as public/private status is now determined by the presence of channel_members rows
- The `files` table has some extra fields (`uploaded_by`, `uploaded_at`) that don't conflict with the Go model
- All foreign key constraints are properly set up
- The simplified RBAC system (Admin, Manager, User, External) is fully implemented

### Future Migrations

For future schema changes, consider:

1. Creating proper migration scripts
2. Adding database migration automation to the startup process
3. Version tracking for schema changes
