## v0.0.7 Implement Result Pattern with Functional Programming and Lazy Evaluation (2025-06-26)

### **feat: implement comprehensive Result Pattern with functional programming approach**

- **Major architectural refactor**: Replace traditional error handling with functional Result Pattern and pattern matching
- Implement generic Result Pattern types in `internal/dto/common_dto.go`:
  - `Error` - Structured error representation with code, message, and details
  - `Exceptional[T]` - Holds either a value T or an exception (equivalent to C# `Exceptional<T>`)
  - `Validation[T]` - Holds either a value T or validation errors (equivalent to C# `Validation<T>`)
  - `Response[T]` - Main response wrapper with lazy evaluation (equivalent to C# `Response<TSuccess>`)
- **Pattern matching**: Implement `Match()` methods for all types with proper functional composition
- **Lazy evaluation**: Producer functions execute only when `Match()` is called, not during construction
- **Type safety**: Full generic type system ensuring compile-time correctness
- **Factory methods**: `Success()`, `Failure()`, `Valid()`, `Invalid()`, `Try()` for clean API
- **Impact**: Eliminated null reference errors, improved error handling predictability, functional programming benefits

### **feat: implement user-specific DTOs and response types with Result Pattern integration**

- Separate generic Result Pattern logic from domain-specific types in `internal/dto/user_dto.go`:
  - `CreateUserRequest`, `UpdateUserRequest`, `ClerkUserSyncRequest` - Input DTOs
  - `UserResponse`, `UserListResponse`, `ClerkUserSyncResponse` - Output DTOs
  - `GetUserResponse`, `GetUsersResponse`, `CreateUserResponse`, etc. - Typed response wrappers
- **Clean separation**: Generic Result Pattern logic remains in `common_dto.go`, user-specific code in `user_dto.go`
- **Consistent API**: All response types follow the same pattern with typed producers
- **Pagination support**: `PaginationRequest` and `PaginationMeta` for consistent list operations
- **HTTP helpers**: `ManagedErrorResult()`, `ErrorsToManagedResult()` for clean API responses
- **Impact**: Improved maintainability, clear separation of concerns, consistent API patterns

### **refactor: update entire service layer to use Result Pattern**

- **Complete rewrite** of `internal/services/user_service.go` to use new Result Pattern:
  - All methods now return typed Response wrappers instead of `(result, error)` tuples
  - `GetUserByID()` → `*dto.GetUserResponse` with lazy validation and database access
  - `GetUserByClerkID()` → `*dto.GetUserResponse` with Clerk ID validation
  - `GetUsers()` → `*dto.GetUsersResponse` with pagination and lazy evaluation
  - `CreateUser()` → `*dto.CreateUserResponse` with validation and conflict detection
  - `UpdateUser()` → `*dto.UpdateUserResponse` with field validation and existence checks
  - `SyncUserFromClerk()` → `*dto.CreateUserResponse` with Clerk integration
  - `ProcessClerkWebhook()` → `*dto.ClerkSyncUserResponse` with webhook processing
- **Enhanced validation**: Comprehensive input validation with structured error reporting
- **Panic safety**: `Try()` wrapper converts panics to Exceptional errors for graceful handling
- **Business logic separation**: Clear distinction between validation errors and system exceptions
- **Impact**: More predictable error handling, better separation of concerns, improved testability

### **feat: update handlers and router to use Result Pattern**

- **Complete refactor** of `internal/handlers/auth.go` and `internal/handlers/users.go`:
  - Replace traditional error checking with Result Pattern `Match()` calls
  - Implement proper HTTP status code mapping based on error types
  - Use `ManagedErrorResult()` and `ErrorsToManagedResult()` for consistent API responses
  - Add comprehensive error logging with context
- **Router updates** in `internal/router/router.go`:
  - Updated all routes to use correct handler method signatures
  - Removed references to non-existent methods
  - Ensured all routes map to available handler functions
- **Mapper fixes** in `internal/mappers/user_mapper.go`:
  - Fixed field mapping to match actual DTO structure
  - Removed references to non-existent fields like `AvatarURL` in `UserResponse`
  - Improved type safety and null pointer handling
- **Impact**: Consistent API responses, better error handling, improved maintainability

### **feat: comprehensive test suite rewrite with Result Pattern**

- **Complete rewrite** of `internal/services/user_service_test.go`:
  - Updated all tests to use Result Pattern `Match()` instead of traditional error checking
  - Implemented proper pattern matching for success/error/validation error cases
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for all service methods with testcontainers integration
  - **Fixed service validation**: Added proper empty update request validation
  - **Enhanced error testing**: Better error message matching and validation
- **DTO test coverage** in `internal/dto/result_test.go` and `internal/dto/user_dto_test.go`:
  - Comprehensive testing of Result Pattern functionality
  - Validation of all factory methods and pattern matching behavior
  - Type safety verification and generic type testing
- **Test execution**: All tests now pass successfully with proper isolation and cleanup
- **Impact**: Reliable test suite, comprehensive coverage, confidence in refactoring

### **refactor: clean up legacy code and remove duplication**

- **Removed all legacy code**: Eliminated old error handling patterns and unused imports
- **Consolidated DTOs**: Moved all user-specific types to dedicated files, kept generic pattern separate
- **Fixed compilation errors**: Updated all imports, method signatures, and type references
- **Eliminated duplication**: Removed redundant code between common and user-specific DTOs
- **Consistent naming**: Aligned all types and methods with established patterns
- **Impact**: Cleaner codebase, reduced technical debt, easier maintenance

### **technical: build system and dependency management**

- **Test execution**: Full test suite passes (21+ seconds of comprehensive testing)
- **Dependency updates**: Added required Go modules for testcontainers and other dependencies
- **Type safety**: Full compile-time verification of generic types and method signatures
- **Impact**: Stable build system, reliable CI/CD readiness, production-ready code
